// Inefficient: This approach is inefficient because it directly accesses the file system to get the usable space. This can be slow and may not provide accurate results if the file system is being modified concurrently.

// Efficient: This approach is more efficient because it uses the StorageManager API, which provides a more reliable and efficient way to get the available space. The StorageManager API can also handle concurrent modifications to the file system and provides a more accurate result.
