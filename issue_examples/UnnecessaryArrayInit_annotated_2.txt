// Inefficient: This code is inefficient because it uses an initializer function to set all values to false, which can be slower than directly creating the array.
val booleans = BooleanArray(3) { false }

// Efficient: This code is efficient because it directly creates a BooleanArray of size 3 without any additional overhead of an initializer function.
