// / Inefficient: PendingIntent.getService() is meant for starting a Service, not for handling user interaction with a notification. Using it for a notification's content intent can lead to unexpected behavior.
NotificationCompat.Builder(context, CHANNEL_ID)

// Efficient: This is the proper way to create a PendingIntent for launching an Activity when the user taps the notification. It ensures that tapping the notification will open the intended Activity. Additionally, the efficient version uses FLAG_IMMUTABLE, which is a security best practice introduced in newer Android versions to prevent PendingIntent mutability issues
PendingIntent.getActivity(context, 0, intent, FLAG_IMMUTABLE)
